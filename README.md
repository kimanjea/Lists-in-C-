 # C# Program README

## Overview

This C# program demonstrates various operations using lists, arrays, and a Fibonacci sequence example. It includes functionalities such as sorting, trimming, converting between lists and arrays, and generating Fibonacci numbers.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have a C# development environment set up to run the program.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed

### Running the Program

1. Clone the repository or download the program file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the program file.
4. Compile and run the program using the following commands:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run


# Program Details
Sorting and Trimming
The program initializes a list of words and documents, sorts the words, and demonstrates both uppercasing and trimming of strings.

# Array Operations
The program converts lists to arrays, iterates through the elements, and checks for the presence of a specific element.

# Fibonacci Sequence
The program generates the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, demonstrating the usage of lists to dynamically store sequence elements.

# Additional Information
The program utilizes basic C# constructs such as loops, conditional statements, and list/array operations.
Feel free to explore the code and modify it for educational purposes or further experimentation.
